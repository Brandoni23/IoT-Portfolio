# Project 2: Rainmaker I2C Temperature Reading

This is my code for adding a widget to the Rainmaker cloud server in app_main.c. It also accesses the temperature data from the app_driver.c code file which uses I2C to get the data. The app_priv.h header file transfers the temperature's global float variable from the driver file to the main file.
