# Introduction 
This is my portfolio for my course ECEG 432 on IoT with Professor Alan Marchiori. My portfolio consists of weekly reports along with my 2 projects that I have worked on throughout the course using C code. There are 2 branches in this repository. The first is the I2C_Honeywell branch where my code reads the I2C protocol between the Master and the Slave using an EXPRESSIF ESP32-S2 and Honeywell's HIH6030 Humidity and Temperature Sensor. The second is the I2C_Rainmaker branch where my code sends the temperature data from the same sensor and sends it to the Rainmaker cloud server through MQTT. The data is access through the Rainmaker mobile app which uses HTTPS.  

This course is also crosslisted as CSCI 332.
