This is my portfolio for my course ECEG 432 on IoT with Professor Alan Marchiori. My portfolio consists of weekly reports along with my 2 projects that I will be working on throughout the course. I have 2 branches in this repository. The first is the I2C_Honeywell branch where my code reads the I2C protocol between the master and the slave. The second is the I2C_Rainmaker branch where my code sends the temperature data from the slave and sends it to the Rainmaker server through MQTT. This course is also crosslisted as CSCI 332.
