# esp-examples

Example programs for the ESP32 used in CSCI 332 / IoT.

## Instructions

Please put your work in your own branch under a subfolder from the root of this repo. For example if you created an ADC example, you might make the "SuperCoolAdc" branch and then put your work in the folder "/SuperCoolAdcExample". When you push your code to the gitlab repo it will give you a URL to create a merge request. Follow the link and create a merge request and I will add your code to the main branch if it looks good.
